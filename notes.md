I learned git add ., git commit -m, git push, git fetch, git status, git pull, and how to resolve merge conflicts.

# Amazon Web Services - Route 53
- Use a domain name to represent the web application to make it easy to remember and secure.
- A domain name can be used to create DNS records that will map domain names to IP addresses (A records) or other domain names (CNAME records).
- DNS Records
    - Root Domain DNS Record = `yourdomain`
    - Subdomain DNS Record = `*.yourdomain`
        - `*` represents a wildcard.
    - Both root domain DNS record and subdomain DNS record have a record type, A.
- Other Records Types
    - The name server (NS) record contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize the user to place DNS records in the DNS server. 
        - Those same authoritative name servers are listed with the registrar that the user leases their domain name from. 
        - That way the authoritative name server can verify that the DNS records and the DNS registration match and are authorized to represent the domain name when defining DNS records.
        - Otherwise, a hacker could just add DNS records and take over the user's domain name.
    - The start of authority (SOA) record provides contact information about the owner of the domain name.
- Acronyms and Terms
    - DNS = Domain Name System
    - NS = Name Server
    - SOA = Start of Authority

# HTTPS, TLS, and Web Certificates
- Usually, only websites that do commerce need a secure connection.
- The web moved from simple document servers (Web 1.0) to full-on web applications (Web 2.0).
- Web 2.0 accepts information from users and displays that information within the application.
- Without a secure connection, anyone who has access to the network traffic, at any point, from the user's computer to the server handling the request could easily capture all the data sent in either direction.
- HTTPS and TLS
    - The secure version of HTTP is called Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTPS).
    - This is basically HTTP with a negotiated secure connection that happens before any data is exchanged.
    - Having a secure connection means that all the data is encrypted using the TLS protocol.
    - TLS is sometimes referred to by a now unsecured predecessor protocol named SSL.
    - TLS works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data.
    - `curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null`
        - The actual negotiation that happens can be seen by using the console browser-based application `curl`, along with the `-v` parameter to see the verbose output of the HTTPS exchange.
        - The `> /dev/null` redirection throws away the actual HTTP response, since we only care about the negotiation, by redirecting the output to the null device.
    - A core piece of the handshake of the negotiation is the exchange of a web certificate that identifies the domain name of the server creating the secure connection.
    - The browser will compare the certificate domain name to the one represented in the URL, and if they do not match, or the certificate is invalid or out of date, it will display a massive warning.
- Web Certificates
    - Web Certificates are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption.
    - The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate.
    - Once the user has a certificate for their domain name, the user can serve the certificate from their web server and then the browser can validate the certificate by using the public keys of the certificate issuer.
    - Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy does not have a web certificate for.
    - When this happens Caddy asks Let's Encrypt to verify that the domain for the requested certificate is actually owned by the requester.
    - Let's Encrypt does that by telling the requester to return a specific digitally signed response for a temporary URL when an HTTP request to the domain is made.
    - Let's Encrypt then makes the HTTP request, and if successful, issues the certificate to the requester.
- Modern browsers now expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication.
- In fact, the next version of HTTP (v3) only supports secure connections.
- For this reason, the user should always support HTTPS for any web application that they build.
- The user can obtain and renew a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for their web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates.
- This is not difficult to do, and many languages such as Rust, Node.js, or Go support this functionality by simply including an additional library.
- Caddy
    - Caddy has ACME support built into it by default.
    - By not specifying a port, the Caddy rule will serve up files using port 443 (HTTPS), and any request to port 80 (HTTP) will automatically redirect the browser to port 443. 
- Acronyms and Terms
    - HTTP = Non-Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - HTTPS - Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - TLS = Transport Layer Security
    - SSL = Secure Sockets Layer
    - IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force
    - ACME = Automatic Certificate Management Environment

# The Console
- Before the creation of graphical user interfaces, all computing systems were simple console environments consisting of a prompt for inputting a command and the display of the command output.
- All of the original programming tools ran as console applications.
- The console tradition is still actively used by professional developers and most programming tools execute within a console window.
- Also known as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console window is an essential web development tool.
- The console provides access to the file system and allows for the execution of command-line applications.
- All operating systems come with a default console.
- In order to successfully use the console for web programming, it must be POSIX compliant.
- POSIX compliance means that it supports a standard set of console commands.
- Both Mac and Linus support POSIX.
- One of the primary purposes of a console application is to view the files on the computer.
- The files on a computer are organized into a tree structure of nodes called directories.
- At any given point in time, the console is located in one of the directories in the file system.
- The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands.
- The input and output of commands can also be chained using special characters.
    - `|` = Take the output from the command on the left and pipe or pass it to the command on the right.
    - `>` = Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists.
    - `>>` = Redirect output to a file. Appends if file exists.
- There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.
    - `CTRL-R`= Use type ahead to find previous commands.
    - `CTRL-C` = Kill the currently running command
- Acronyms and Terms
    - POSIX = Portable Operating System Interface
- Commands
    - `echo` = output the parameters of the command
    - `cd` = change directory
    - `mkdir` = make directory
    - `rmdir` = remove directory
    - `rm` = remove file(s)
    - `mv` = move file(s)
    - `cp` = copy file(s)
    - `ls` = list files
    - `curl` = command line client URL browser
    - `grep` = regular expression search
    - `find` = find files
    - `top` = view running processes with CPU and memory usage
    - `df` = view disk statistics
    - `cat` = output the content of a file
    - `less` = interactively output the contents of a file
    - `wc` = count the words in a file
    - `ps` = view the currently running processes
    - `kill` = kill a currently running process
    - `sudo` = execute a command as a super user (admin)
    - `ssh` = create a secure shell on a remote computer
    - `scp` = securely copy files to a remote computer
    - `history` = show the history of commands
    - `ping` = check if a website is up

    - `man` = look up a command in the manual
    - `pwd` = present working directory

# HTML Input
- HTML Elements
    - `form`
        - Input container and submission 
        - `<form action="form.html" method="post">`
            - The `method="post"` attribute in an HTML form specifies how the browser should send form data to the server. When using `method="post"`, the form data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL.
            - The `POST` method is typically used for forms that change server data (like database updates), while the `GET` method is used for forms that request data without side effects (like a search form).
    - `fieldset`
        - Labeled input group
        - `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`
            - The `<fieldset>` tag in HTML is used to group related elements within a form. It draws a box around the related form items, making the form easier to understand and navigate. This is particularly useful when a form has multiple sections or categories of inputs.
    - `input`
        - Multiple types of user input
            - `<input type=" />`
    - `select`
        - Selection dropdown
        - `<select><option>1</option></select>`
    - `optgroup`
        - Grouped selection dropdown
        - `<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>`
    - `option`
        - Selection option
        - `<option selected>option2</option>`
    - `textarea`
        - Multiline text input
        - `<textarea></textarea>`
    - `label`
        - Individual input label
        - `<label for="range">Range: </label>`
    - `output`
        - Output of input
        - `<output for="range">0</output>`
    - `meter`
        - Display value with a known range
        - `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>`
- Form Element
    - The main purpose of the form `element` is to submit the values of the inputs it contains.
    - Before JavaScript was introduced, the `form` container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input.
    - For example, in a single-page application, the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction.
    - With this ability, the data may not even be sent to the server.
    - This greatly reduces the necessity of the `form` element, but it is often still used simply as a container.
- Example:
- `<form action="submission.html" method="post">`
    - `<label for="ta">TextArea: </label>`
    - `<textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">`
- `Some text`
    - `</textarea>`
    - `<button type="submit">Submit</button>`
- `</form>`
    - The `for` attribute in the `<label>` tag specifies which form element a label is bound to. In this case, `for="ta"` means that this label is associated with the form element that has the id of `"ta"`.
    - The `id` attribute specifies a unique id for the HTML element. It is used here to link the `<textarea>` with its `<label>`. Since the id is  `"ta"`, it matches the `for="ta"` in the `<label>`, establishing the connection between them.
    - The `name` attribute is named `"ta-id"` in the `<textarea>`. This is important for when the form is submitted. The data entered into this `<textarea>` will be sent to the server as part of the HTTP request with `"ta-id"` as the key. For instance, if a user types "Hello" in the textarea, the server receives this data in the form of ta-id=Hello.
    - Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server.
    - The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's `name` attribute with the current value of the textarea.
        - ta-id=Some+text
- Input Elements
    - The input elements represent many different input types.
    - The type of input is set with the `type` attribute.
    - Different input types include different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.
        - `text` = single line textual value
        - `pass` = obscured password
        - `email` = email address
        - `tel` = telephone number
        - `url` = URL address
        - `number` = numerical value
        - `checkbox` = inclusive selection
        - `radio` = exclusive selection
        - `range` = range limited number
        - `date` = year, month, day
        - `datetime-local` = date and time
        - `month` = year, month
        - `week` = week of year
        - `color` = color
        - `file` = local file
        - `submit` = button to trigger form submission
    - In order to create an input, the desired `type` attribute is specified along with any other attribute associated with that specific input.
- Example: `<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />`
    - Most input elements share some common attributes.
        - `name` = The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form.
        - `disabled` = Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input.
        - `value` = The initial value of the input
        - `required` = Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid.
- Input Validation
    - Several of the input elements have validation built into them.
    - This means that they will not accept a value that is not, for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address.
    - The `required` attribute can also be specified on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted.
    - The `pattern` attribute exists on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password` inputs.
    - When present, the `pattern` attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered valid.
    - Validation should also be built into HavaScript for checking input data to ensure everything is valid before it is submitted.
    - All of the input elements support functions for determining their validation state.
    - Additionally, there are CSS style selectors for visualizing the validity of the input.
    - In order to have a good user experience, it is critical that sufficient user feedback is provided early in the input process.
    - A good design will give feedback as, or before, the user begins to input.
    - A poor design will keep the user guessing as to why the data is not being accepted, or even if it was accepted.
- CodenPen Assignment
    - `<ul>`
        - In HTML, the `<ul>` tag stands for "Unordered List." It is a way to create a list of items that do not have a specific order or hierarchy. The `<ul>` tag is typically used for bulleted lists, where the order of items is not important.
        - Here is how to use the `<ul>` tag:
            - Wrap the entire list with `<ul>` tags.
            - Each item in the list is placed within an `<li>` (List Item) tag.
    - `<input type="text" id="text" name="varText" placeholder="text here" required pattern="[Aa].*" />`
        - The `pattern="[Aa].*"` attribute in HTML is used within an `<input>` element, typically of `type="text"` or similar, to specify a regular expression that the input's value must match in order for the form to be submitted.
        - Here is a breakdown of what this specific pattern means:
            - `Aa`: This part of the pattern means that the input value must start with either an uppercase "A" or a lowercase "a".
            - `.*`: This part of the pattern is a regular expression that matches any sequence of characters (including no characters at all). The dot `.` represents any character (except newline), and the asterisk `*` means "zero or more occurrences of the preceding element."
    - `<!-- Submit form with POST method and enctype="multipart/form-data" to send file contents. -->`
        - `POST` Method: When a form is submitted with the `method="post"` attribute, the form data is sent in the request body, not in the URL. This is typically used for sending large amounts of data and is more secure than `GET` because the data does not appear in the URL.
        - `enctype="multipart/form-data"`: This attribute specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitting it to the server. The `enctype="multipart/form-data"` is necessary when a form includes any `<input type="file">` elements because it allows files to be uploaded to the server. It is used when the form is meant to perform file uploads along with other text fields.
    - `<input type="tel" id="tel" name="varTel" placeholder="###-####" pattern="\d{3}-\d{4}" />`
        - The `pattern="\d{3}-\d{4}"` attribute in an HTML `<input type="tel">` element is a regular expression that specifies a validation pattern the inputted data must match for the form to be submitted. Let's break down what this specific pattern means:
            - `\d`: This represents a digit (0-9). It is a shorthand character class in regular expressions that matches any single digit.
            - `{3}`: This quantifier specifies that exactly three occurrences of the preceding element (in this case, a digit) must be present.
            - `-`: This is a literal dash character. It must appear exactly as it is in the user's input.
            - `\d{4}`: This means that four digits must follow the dash.
    - `<output id="rangeOutput" for="range">0</output>`
        - The `<output>` element in conjunction with the `<input type="range">` serves as a way to display the current value of the range input dynamically. This is particularly useful for providing immediate visual feedback to the user, as the default range input does not always show the current value while it is being adjusted.

# HTML Media
- The HTML elements that represent media include `img`, `augio`, `video`, `svg`, and `canvas`.
- The `img`, `audio`, and `video` elements are all simple references to an external file, but `svg` and `canvas` both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.
- External Media
    - The media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute.
    - The path represented by the URL can either be a relative path or a full path.
    -  A full path includes the protocol. domain name, and path to the file.
        - https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg
    - A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element.
    - The path should be made as relative as possible so that the code can be moved around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references.
    - For example, if the HTML page is located in a directory with a subdirectory named `images` that contains a file named `photo.jpg`, a relative path would be used as follows.
        - images/photo.jpg
- Image
    - To include an image in the content, use the `img` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source image.
    - In order to support accessibility, an `alt` attribute should also be included that describes the image.
    - A full `img` element would look like the following:
        - `<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />`
- Audio
    - To include an audio file in the content, use the `audio` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source audio file.
    - The `controls` attribute can be included to enable the user to control the audio playback.
    - If the `controls` are not displayed, then there is no visual representation of the audio on the rendered page.
    - The `autoplay` attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the `loop` attribute keeps it playing over and over.
    - Note that automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior is provided.
        - `<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>`
- Video
    - To include a video in the content, use the `video` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source video.
    - Like the `audio` element, the `controls` or `autoplay` attributes can be included.
    - Note that the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute may need to be included if requesting files from a different domain than the one serving the content.
- Example:
- `<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">`
    - `<source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />`
- `</video>`
- Internal Media
- The internal media elements `svg` and `canvas` allow the programmer to actually create images directly within the HTML.
    - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
        - SCG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in HTML.
- Example:
- `<svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">`
    - `<circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />`
- `</svg>`
    - `viewBox="0 0 300 200"`: This attribute defines the position and dimension, in user space, of an SVG viewport. Here, it is creating a viewport of 300 units wide and 200 units high.
    - `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`: This specifies the XML namespace for SVG. It is necessary for the SVG to be correctly interpreted.
    - `stroke="red"` and `fill="red"`: These attributes set the stroke (border) and fill (interior) colors of all shapes contained within this SVG element to red.
    - `style="border: 1px solid #000000"`: This applies CSS styling to the SVG element, giving it a 1-pixel solid black border.
    - `cx="150"` and `cy="100"`: These attributes define the x and y coordinates of the center of the circle. Given the viewBox size, this places the center of the circle in the middle of the SVG element.
    - `r="50"`: This sets the radius of the circle to 50 units.
        - Some amazing visualizations can be produced combined with JavaScript and CSS.
    - Canvas
        - The `canvas` element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation.
        - The HTML for the `canvas` element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support.

# HTML Structure
- The two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to the web application.
- Some of the common HTML structural elements include `body`, `header`, `footer`, `main`, `section`, `aside`, `p`, `table`, `ol/ul`, `div`, and `span`.
- HTML Structural Elements
    - `p` = paragraph
    - `b` = bold
    - `nav` = navigation
    - `div` = division
    - `aside` = content that does not fit the content flow of the sections
- Tags
    - `<a>` = anchor
        - Each `<a>` element has an `href` attribute that points to the respective websites.
    - `<tr>` = table row
    - `<th>` = table header
    - `<td>` = table data
- Properly representing the page structure using the elements is important not only so it makes logical sense to a programmer, but also so that automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.
- Block and Inline
    - There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs. inline.
    - A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure.
    - An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element.
    - In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content.
    - For example, the block element `div` could have an inline element `b` in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text.
    - Likewise, a `p` element could have a `span` to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

# Startup HTML
- An HTML file is needed for each of the main components of the application.
- The default component of the application must be represented in a file named `index.html` since that is the file a browser will load by default.
- A placeholder is needed for all the technologies that will eventually be needed to represent the application.
    - Application data: A rendering of application data that will eventually populate.
    - For Simon, this is the simple SVG graphic buttons, the user name, and a random inspirational quote.
    - Authentication: An input for the user to create an account and login.
    - The user's name should be displayed after they log in.
    - Database data: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database.
    - For Simon, this is the highest score of all players.
    - WebSocket data: A rendering of data that is received from the server.
    - This may be real-time data sent from other users (e.g. chat or scoring data), or real-time data that the service is generating (e.g. stock prices or latest high scores).
    - For Simon, this updates every time another user creates or ends a game.
- Once the application is developed to where it is wanted, it needs to be released to the production environment.
- `./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup`
- Doing this will make this deliverable of the startup available from `https://startup.yourdomainname`.

# Simon HTML
- index.html
    - `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`
        - A metadata element in HTML is used to provide information about the HTML document, which is not displayed directly on the web page itself. This information is primarily intended for web browsers, search engines, and other automated systems that process the web page. Metadata elements are placed within the `<head>` section of an HTML document.
        - `UTF-8`: This is a character encoding that encompasses almost all characters and symbols in use around the world. By specifying UTF-8, you ensure that the browser correctly interprets the text in your HTML document. This is especially important for displaying non-ASCII characters like those found in many languages other than English. Without this specification, browsers might default to a different encoding, potentially misinterpreting special characters in your document.
    - `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />`
        - `<link>` Tag: This tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. It is placed within the `<head>` section of an HTML document.
        - `rel="icon"`: The `rel` (relationship) attribute specifies the type of relationship that the document has with the linked resource. In this case, `icon` indicates that the linked resource is an icon representing the document.
        - `href="favicon.ico"`: The href attribute specifies the path to the icon file. In this example, it points to a file named favicon.ico. This file should be located in the same directory as the HTML file or the path should be adjusted to point to the correct location where the icon file is stored.
    - `<hr />`
        - The `<hr />` tag in HTML is used to create a horizontal rule or line across the webpage. It serves as a thematic break in an HTML page, often to divide content or to denote a shift in topic within a page. It is self-closing.
    - `<br />`
        - The `<br />` tag in HTML is used to insert a line break in the text. It stands for "break" and is typically employed to create a new line in the content, without starting a new paragraph. It is self-closing.
- play.html
    - The `class` attribute
        - CSS Styling: The primary reason for using the class attribute is to define a specific scope for CSS styling. By assigning a class to an HTML element, you can target that element in your CSS stylesheet to apply specific styles. For example, any CSS rules defined for the class `player-name` will apply to all elements with that class.
        - JavaScript Interaction: Classes can also be used as selectors in JavaScript to manipulate elements. For instance, you can easily select all elements with the class player-name and apply JavaScript functions to them.
    - When to use `<div>`?
        - Grouping Elements: `<div>` is commonly used to group together elements for styling purposes. By placing a set of elements inside a `<div>`, you can apply CSS styles to them collectively, rather than individually.
        - Layout Purposes: `<div>` elements are often used as containers to create different sections or areas within a web page, such as headers, footers, navigation bars, or content sections. 
        - Applying CSS Classes or IDs: When you want to apply specific CSS classes or IDs to a part of your webpage for styling or scripting purposes, wrapping these elements in a `<div>` can be an efficient way to do this.
        - JavaScript Targeting: If you need a container to target with JavaScript—for instance, to dynamically load content or handle user interactions—a `<div>` can serve as a useful hook.
    - `<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 100 100" height="100" width="100">`
        - `aria-hidden="true"`
            - Accessibility: The attribute tells assistive technologies to skip the SVG element. This is useful when the SVG is purely decorative and does not contribute to the understanding of the page's content, or when an alternative representation of the SVG content is provided elsewhere on the page.
            - Screen Readers: Screen readers and other assistive technologies will not read or describe the content of the SVG element. This helps prevent redundant or irrelevant information from being announced to users who rely on these technologies.
        - `<path d="M 95,5 95,95 5,95 Q 5,5 95,5" fill="green" />`
            - `d="M 95,5 95,95 5,95 Q 5,5 95,5"`
                - `M 95,5`: The `M` command stands for "moveto". It moves the pen to a new location without drawing anything. Here, it moves to the point (95,5).
                - `95,95 5,95`: After moving to (95,5), the pen draws a line to (95,95), then another line to (5,95). This is implied by the lack of a command letter before the coordinates, meaning it continues the last command, which in this case is drawing a line.
                - `Q 5,5 95,5`: The Q command stands for a quadratic Bézier curve. This curve requires two points: the control point and the endpoint. The control point (5,5) determines the curvature, and the endpoint (95,5) is where the curve finishes.
- deployFiles.sh
    - Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)
        - This line indicates that the script should be executed using Bash, a common Unix shell.
    - Option Parsing (`getopts`)
        - The `getopts` command is used to parse command-line options. In this script, it looks for three options: `-k`, `-h`, and `-s`.
            - `-k` is for specifying a PEM key file, which is likely used for SSH authentication.
            - `-h` is for specifying the hostname of the remote server.
            - `-s` is for specifying the service name.
    - Variables (`key`, `hostname`, `service`)
        - These variables are assigned the values provided by the command line options.
    - Input Validation
        - The script checks if any of the variables key, hostname, or service are empty. If any are, it prints an error message and exits.
    - Deployment Notification
        - If all required parameters are provided, the script prints a message indicating that it is deploying files for the specified service to the specified hostname using the provided key.
    - Step 1: Clearing Previous Distribution
        - The script logs into the remote server (`ubuntu@$hostname`) using SSH with the specified key.
        - Once logged in, it removes the existing `public` directory within the specified service's directory and then creates a new `public` directory.
            - `rm -rf services/${service}/public`: Removes the existing public directory.
            - `mkdir -p services/${service}/public`: Creates a new public directory, along with any necessary parent directories.
    - Step 2: Copying Distribution Package
        - The script then uses scp (secure copy) to copy the distribution package to the target server.
            - `scp -r -i "$key" * ubuntu@$hostname:services/$service/public`: This copies all files (`*`) from the current directory on the local machine to the `public` directory of the service on the remote server.

# Startup HTML Deliverable
- In HTML, the `<input>` tag is used for creating interactive fields where users can enter data. For example, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons are all created using the `<input>` tag.
- On the other hand, the `<p>` tag is used for defining paragraphs of text. It is a block-level element that represents a block of text that can be styled with CSS to change its appearance.
- The `id` attribute is for singular, and the `class` attribute is for broad.
- `method="get"`: The method attribute specifies how to send form data. The `get` method appends the form data to the URL in name/value pairs. It is visible to everyone (it will be displayed in the browser's address bar) and has limits on the amount of information to send (maximum URL length is around 2048 characters).
- `action="play.html"`: The action attribute defines the location (a URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted. In this case, the data is sent to a web page named `play.html`, which is where the server-side processing would take place.
- The `target="_blank"` attribute in an `<a>` (anchor) tag specifies that the linked document (the href URL) should open in a new tab or window rather than in the current frame or window. This is commonly used when the website designer wants to keep their website open in the user's browser while also directing them to an external site or resource.
